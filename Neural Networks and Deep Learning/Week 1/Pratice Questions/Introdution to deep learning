1. What does the analogy “AI is the new electricity” refer to?

  [ ] Through the “smart grid”, AI is delivering a new wave of electricity.
  
  [ ] AI runs on computers and is thus powered by electricity, but it is letting computers do things not possible before.
  
  [ ] Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries.
  
  [*] AI is powering personal devices in our homes and offices, similar to electricity.

2. Which of these are reasons for Deep Learning recently taking off? (Check the three options that apply.)

  [ ] Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important 
  applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition.
  
  [*] We have access to a lot more data.
  
  [*] We have access to a lot more computational power.
  
  [ ] Neural Networks are a brand new field.

4. When an experienced deep learning engineer works on a new problem, 
they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, 
without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?

  [ ] True
  [*] False

5. look the figure 5

6. Images for cat recognition is an example of “structured” data, 
because it is represented as a structured array in a computer. True/False?

  [ ] True
  [*] False

7. A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, 
economic growth is an example of “unstructured” data because it contains data coming from different sources. True/False?

   [ ] True
   [*] False

8. Why is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) used for machine translation, say translating English to French? (Check all that apply.)

   [*] It can be trained as a supervised learning problem.
   
   [ ] It is strictly more powerful than a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
   
   [*] It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g., a sequence of words).
   
   [ ] RNNs represent the recurrent process of Idea->Code->Experiment->Idea->....

9. look the figure 9

10. Assuming the trends described in the previous question's figure are accurate (and hoping you got the axis labels right), 
which of the following are true? (Check all that apply.)

   [*] Increasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
   
   [*] Increasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
   
   [ ] Decreasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
   
   [ ] Decreasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
